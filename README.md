# b450x-ardupilot
Just some settings and things for when I fitted Pixhawk to my old Blade 450X helicopter

## Disclaimer ##
Use these settings at your own risk.  All helis are different.  I'm no expert in Ardupilot.  These are the settings that work for me, they may not be entirely correctly set up.

## What's here ##

PARAMS.TXT - My Arducopter Parameters file.

PIXMOUNT.DXF - The mounting plates that go between the frame and the skids.  I used earplugs as vibration dampers.

MOUNTING.JPG - How I mounted the pixhawk.

TIPS.TXT - Most of setting it up was pretty easy.  There were a few things I learned along the way that may help.
